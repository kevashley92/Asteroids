# Asteroids
This is my implementation of the classic Asteroids game that I made for a Computer Graphics course.

In order the play the game, the user must have OpenGL installed on their machine as well as GLUT.

To run the game, the user has to open the asteroids.sln file in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  Once open, the user can play the game by opening the Solution Explorer then navigating to "asteroid > Source Files > asteroid.cpp". Once that is done, simply play the game by clicking the green play button at the top.
